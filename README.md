### Introduction
I am a webgl beginer. Fallowing the tutorial "The Making of 'The Aviator': Animating a Basic 3D Scene with Three.js" by Karim Maaloul, I make this game demo for any person which interest in webgl.   
Just download the demo, open the index.html file and you play the game.   
**Note**: You will come meet some problem about webgl when use console to show the problem. Because treejs is based on webgl. You try update the graphics driver for it.
